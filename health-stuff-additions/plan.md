# Multimodal AI Health Assistant MVP Plan

## Executive Summary

Building a personal multimodal AI health assistant MVP - initially just for personal use to validate the concept. Inspired by Patrick Hsu's vision, this starts as a simple tool for tracking meals via photos and integrating with personal health data. Once proven valuable, it can scale to serve health-obsessed individuals (Bryan Johnson types, LA health influencers) who are willing to invest in comprehensive health tracking and optimization.

## Vision & Context

### The Problem
- Health data is fragmented across multiple devices, apps, and services
- No unified AI system that can understand the full context of someone's health journey
- High activation barrier for comprehensive health tracking
- Missing the network effects that could enable population-level insights and RCTs

### The Solution
A multimodal AI health assistant that:
- Accepts food photos and analyzes nutritional content
- Integrates with wearables (Whoop, Oura, Apple Watch, etc.)
- Tracks blood work, supplements, medications
- Understands genetic data
- Provides personalized recommendations based on ALL data streams
- Enables community-driven experiments and RCTs

### Target Audience (Initial)

## Narrative & Philosophy

This isn't just another health tracking app. It's about creating a new paradigm where AI truly understands the full context of your health journey. Every meal photo, every heartbeat measured, every blood test result - they all tell a story. Our AI doesn't just count calories or track steps; it understands the intricate relationships between what you eat, how you sleep, your genetic predispositions, and how you feel.

For the Bryan Johnsons of the world, this is the tool that finally brings all their optimization efforts under one roof. For someone struggling with chronic fatigue, this might be the system that finally identifies the pattern they've been missing. 

The network effects are crucial - when thousands of health optimizers share (anonymized) data, we can run population-level experiments that were previously impossible. Imagine being able to ask: "What happens to HRV when people with my genetic markers eat this specific food?" and getting real answers based on real data.

This MVP is intentionally expensive and exclusive. We're not trying to be MyFitnessPal. We're building the Ferrari of health optimization tools - premium, comprehensive, and obsessively detailed. The early adopters will be our co-creators, helping us understand what the future of personalized health looks like.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Addressing Key Challenges (from Review)

#### 1. Meal Photo Analysis (Solving Â±25% Portion Error)
```typescript
// Instead of relying only on AI, add portion selector
interface MealCapture {
  photo: File
  portionSize: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'custom'
  customGrams?: number
}

// Optimized prompt with portion context
const analyzePrompt = `
Analyze this ${portionSize} portion meal:
1. Identify all visible foods
2. Estimate macros based on ${portionSize} portion
3. Return confidence level (0-1)
4. Flag if portion unclear
Format as strict JSON schema.
`
```

#### 2. Cost Optimization & Performance
- **Image resizing**: 448px max dimension (80% token reduction)
- **Normalize before hashing**: Resize + JPEG encode to avoid duplicate hashes
- **Response caching**: Hash-based deduplication
- **Cold start fix**: Vercel Cron hits `/api/ping` every 5 min to keep warm
- **Estimated cost**: ~$0.0025/meal â $1-3/month personal use

#### 3. Simple Development Flow
```bash
# Quick start
npx create-next-app@latest health-ai --typescript --tailwind --app
npm install @supabase/supabase-js openai recharts date-fns sharp

# Environment setup
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> .env.local
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=..." >> .env.local

# Run locally
npm run dev
```

#### 4. File Structure
```
/app
  /api
    /analyze/route.ts      -- Vision API endpoint
    /meals/route.ts        -- CRUD operations
  /(app)
    /page.tsx             -- Camera/upload
    /history/page.tsx     -- Meal history
    /insights/page.tsx    -- Simple charts
/components
  /meal-capture.tsx       -- Photo + portion UI
  /meal-card.tsx          -- Display results
/lib
  /supabase.ts           -- Client setup
  /vision.ts             -- OpenAI integration
```

## Implementation Approach

### Lean Background Job Pattern (No Queues)
1. **Photo upload** â `POST /api/analyze`
   - Check cache by normalized hash
   - Call Vision API if miss
   - Store in cache
   - Return immediately

2. **Terra webhook** â `POST /api/terra-ingest`
   - Write raw data fast
   - Don't transform in request

3. **Daily digest** â Vercel Cron â `/api/daily-digest`
   - Postgres function aggregates data
   - Write summary row

### Realistic Timeline (Solo Developer)
| Task | Hours | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Next.js + Supabase setup | 4 | Use `supabase init` |
| Camera upload + Vision API | 6 | Sharp for resize |
| Meal history + CSV export | 4 | TanStack Table |
| Supabase RLS + Auth | 3 | Magic email links |
| Terra integration | 4 | React widget |
| Cron jobs + charts | 3 | Vercel + Recharts |
| **Total** | **~24 hours** | 3 nights + weekend |

### Platform Limits to Watch
- **Vercel Hobby**: 2 Cron jobs, 10s function timeout
- **Supabase Free**: 500MB DB, 1GB storage, pauses after 1 week inactive
- **Terra Free**: 100 API calls/month (upgrade when adding users)

### What to Skip for MVP
- Stripe payments (until second user)
- Genetic data import (month 2)
- Native mobile apps (PWA is enough)
- Complex auth flows (use magic links)

## Next Steps

1. **Hour 1-4**: Set up Next.js + Supabase with RLS enabled
2. **Hour 5-10**: Build normalized photo capture + Vision API
3. **Hour 11-14**: Add meal history with proper caching
4. **Hour 15-18**: Basic auth + personal dashboard
5. **Hour 19-24**: Terra widget + simple insights
6. **Week 2+**: Use it daily, iterate based on actual needs
