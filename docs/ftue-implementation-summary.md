# FTUE Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the First-Time User Experience (FTUE) features based on the early-proto.md design into the existing Next.js/Supabase PWA.

## Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema (✅ Complete)
- Created migration files:
  - `20250108_add_ftue_tables.sql` - Added personality_profiles, memories, conversations tables
  - `20250108_seed_assessment_quests.sql` - Seeded Big Five, Values, and Attachment Style assessment quests
- Added columns to quest_templates: `order_index`, `is_assessment`

### 2. Type System Updates (✅ Complete)
- Extended types in `src/types/`:
  - `quests.ts` - Added orderIndex and isAssessment fields
  - `auth.ts` - Added FTUEData interface with valuesRanking, bigFive, attachmentStyle
  - `chat.ts` - Added profile field to ChatRequestBody
- Created `src/lib/constants.ts` for centralized constants

### 3. FTUE Flow (✅ Complete)
- Created new components:
  - `FTUEFlow.tsx` - Main flow controller replacing OnboardingFlow
  - `ValuesRankingStep.tsx` - New step for ranking core values
  - `FTUEContext.tsx` - Context provider for FTUE state management
- Updated flow: welcome → goals → personalityStyle → valuesRanking → done
- Integrated with `/api/profile` for server persistence

### 4. API Endpoints (✅ Complete)
- `/api/profile` - POST/GET for personality profile management
- `/api/journey` - GET for fetching memories and conversations
- `/api/transcribe` - POST for voice transcription using Groq Whisper
- `/api/breakthrough` - POST for detecting breakthrough moments

### 5. Navigation & Layout (✅ Complete)
- Created `BottomNav.tsx` - Mobile-style bottom navigation
- Updated root layout to include BottomNav
- Added safe-area CSS support for iOS devices
- Pages now have proper mobile-optimized headers

### 6. Chat UI Overhaul (✅ Complete)
- Full-screen chat interface
- Integrated voice input with `MicButton.tsx`
- Updated message styling to match early-proto design
- Chat now sends personality profile data with each request

### 7. Journey Page (✅ Complete)
- Created `/journey` page with:
  - Personality profile visualization (Big Five traits, values, attachment style)
  - Memories & breakthrough moments display
  - Past conversations timeline
- Components: `MemoryCard.tsx`, `TimelineItem.tsx`

### 8. AI Integration Updates (✅ Complete)
- Created `buildSystemPrompt()` helper for dynamic prompt generation
- Integrated personality data into chat system prompts
- Added breakthrough detection that runs every 5 messages
- Using constants for model IDs (Sonnet, Whisper)

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
Add to `.env.local`:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### Database Migrations
Run the following migrations in Supabase SQL editor:
1. `supabase/migrations/20250108_add_ftue_tables.sql`
2. `supabase/migrations/20250108_seed_assessment_quests.sql`

### Type Generation
After running migrations:
```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/types/db.ts
```

## Implementation Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Anonymous Users**: Data stored locally in localStorage, synced to DB with anon_uid
2. **Authenticated Users**: Data persisted to personality_profiles table
3. **Profile Enrichment**: Chat messages include full personality context
4. **Memory Generation**: Automatic breakthrough detection during conversations

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Single Source of Truth**: personality_profiles table with uid as primary key
2. **Assessment Quests**: Special quest type with is_assessment flag
3. **Voice Input**: Client-side MediaRecorder → Groq Whisper API
4. **Breakthrough Detection**: Async, non-blocking analysis after every 5 messages
5. **Mobile-First**: Bottom navigation, full-screen views, safe-area support

## Pending Items

### Quest System Refactor
While the assessment quests are seeded, the full quest system refactor for handling assessment-type quests needs completion:
- Update QuestCard to handle assessment question UI
- Implement quest completion → personality profile update logic
- Add enforcement for single active assessment limit

### Testing Required
1. Full FTUE flow walkthrough
2. Voice transcription on different browsers/devices
3. Breakthrough detection accuracy
4. Profile data persistence across sessions
5. Safe-area rendering on iOS devices

## Next Steps
1. Run database migrations
2. Add GROQ_API_KEY to environment
3. Test FTUE flow end-to-end
4. Complete quest system assessment handling
5. Deploy to Vercel with updated environment variables
